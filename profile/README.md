Here at HRRKoin, we strongly believe in the amazing possibilities of AI and blockchain technology. We're imagining a future where how we exchange value and do transactions could completely change for the better. But, we know that making this future happen needs all of us to work together. That's why we're shaping the development of HRRKoin based on a really important idea we value a lot: "TIE," which stands for Transparency, Inclusiveness, and Empowerment
